# Autonomy Index 2023

## Purpose
The aims of this study were twofold: to examine which networks are specialized when an individualized approach is taken, and to identify which connections are contributing the most to a given network's specialization. These aims were addressed through implementing the autonomy index across three datasets, and with a novel method of deconstructing network specialization.

<Coming Soon!>

## Getting Started 
Scripts are organized in the following folders: preproc, ind_parc, fc_matrices, ai_spec, dAI, and stats.

* The preproc folder contains scripts for data organization, FreeSurfer, resting-state preprocessing (the CBIG2016 pipeline), and tSNR calculation.
* The ind_parc folder contains scripts for running the Kong2019 MS-HBM pipeline and visualization.
* The fc_matrices folder contains scripts for generating individual-averaged functional connectivity matrices.
* The ai_spec folder contains scripts for calculating the autonomy index using individual parcellations.
* The dAI folder contains scripts for calculating the deconstructed autonomy index.
* The stats folder contains scripts for manuscript figure generation and statistical analyses.

README files can be found in each folder, so please see those for additional details.

## Tutorial Guide 
Step-by-step walkthroughs are avaialble for the preprocessing and MS-HBM parcellation steps on [NeuroDocs](https://neurodocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
