# Autonomy Index 2023

## Purpose

## Associated Publications 
<Coming Soon!>

## Getting Started 
Scripts are organized in the following folders: preproc, ind_parc, fc_matrices, ai_spec, reliability, and stats.

The preproc folder contains scripts for data organization, FreeSurfer, resting-state preprocessing (the CBIG2016 pipeline), and tSNR calculation. The ind_parc folder contains scripts for running the Kong2019 MS-HBM pipeline and visualization. The fc_matrices folder contains scripts for generating individual-averaged functional connectivity matrices. The ai_spec folder contains scripts for calculating the autonomy index and deconstructed autonomy index. The reliability folder contains scripts used to run various reliability analyses. The stats folder contains scripts for manuscript figure generation and statistical analyses. README files can be found in each folder, so please see those for additional details.

## Tutorial Guide 
Step-by-step walkthroughs are avaialble for the preprocessing and MS-HBM parcellation steps on [NeuroDocs(neurodocs.readthedocs.io)][NeuroDocs].

## Contact
For questions concerning script usage, please contact us through our lab webpage: https://brain.byu.edu/contact. Any questions regarding the usage of software/pipelines developed by other labs (e.g., fMRIprep) should be directed to their respective forums. Best of luck!
